/*
    useRef Hook

    Let's take a look at the final hook, useRef.

    When it comes to useRef, there are two scenarios:
    - As a read-only ref for a DOM element
    - Or as a mutable value which can behave like an instance variable

    Let's look at typing for both of those scenarios.

    return(
        <div className='App'>
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
